# ScholarU

ScholarU specializes in marketing scholarships to prospective students, specifically those aiming to major in **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)** fields such as computer science, software engineering, biology, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and more. Our platform is designed to match students with scholarships tailored to their unique credentials, including their area of study, enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate, graduate), location, GPA, and other relevant criteria.
